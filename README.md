# Hacktoberfest HTML Starter

Welcome to the Hacktoberfest HTML Starter repository! This repository is designed to help HTML beginners get started with contributing to open source projects during Hacktoberfest. Whether you're new to coding or just starting with HTML, this is a great place to begin your open source journey.

## What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is an annual event that encourages open source contributions during the month of October. It's a fantastic opportunity for beginners to get involved in the open source community, learn about version control systems like Git, and collaborate on projects with developers from around the world.

## Getting Started

If you're new to HTML or haven't used Git before, don't worry! We'll walk you through the process step by step.

### 1. Fork this Repository

Click the "Fork" button at the top right corner of this repository to create your own copy. This will allow you to make changes to the code without affecting the original project.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

Now, you need to clone your forked repository to your local machine. Open your terminal (or command prompt) and run the following command, replacing `<your-github-username>` with your actual GitHub username:

`bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/hacktoberfest-html-starter.git
`

This will create a local copy of the repository on your computer.

### 3. Create a New HTML File

Inside the cloned repository, create a new HTML file. You can name it whatever you like, but let's call it `yourname.html` for this example. You can use a code editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or even a simple text editor like Notepad to create your HTML file.

Here's a basic example of what your `yourname.html` file could look like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello, Hacktoberfest!</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, Hacktoberfest!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my contribution!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Feel free to add more HTML code and be creative!

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Once you've created your HTML file, it's time to commit your changes. In your terminal, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd hacktoberfest-html-starter
```

Then add and commit your changes with the following commands:

```bash
git add yourname.html
git commit -m "Add my HTML contribution"
```

### 5. Push Your Changes

Now, push your changes to your GitHub repository:

```bash
git push origin main
```

### 6. Create a Pull Request

Go back to your GitHub repository on the web. You should see a message indicating that you've recently pushed a branch. Click on the "Compare & pull request" button to create a pull request.

Fill out the pull request form with a brief description of your contribution, and then click the "Create pull request" button.

### 7. Celebrate!

Congratulations! You've just made your first open source contribution. Now, your pull request will be reviewed by the repository's maintainers. If everything looks good, it will be merged into the project, and you'll have successfully completed a Hacktoberfest contribution!

## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project follows the [Hacktoberfest Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Be respectful and considerate of others when contributing to this repository.

## Happy Hacking!

We hope you have a fantastic Hacktoberfest experience and that this HTML starter repository helps you get started on your open source journey. Feel free to explore other open source projects and continue contributing to the community. Happy hacking!
